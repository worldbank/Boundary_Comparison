# Conclusion
There are still some outstanding questions, but overall, the difference between the datasets in Kenya and Uzbekistan seem minimal, but the effect is stronger in Vietnam. Regardless, before we decide on a solution, there are some outstanding questions.

## Questions
### Why are the internal admin2 boundaries simplified?
I was under the impression that the simplified boundaries from IMA were of the national, adm0 borders. However, in the examples I have downloaded from our [internal application](https://rvgs-b7fn.accessdomain.com/wb-global-admin-divisions/#country/237), the admin2 boundaries are simplified across the dataset, not just the international borders.

Does the World Bank have admin2 boundaries with the internal detail of what was shared from IMA?
