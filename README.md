# Comparing boundaries

In support of ongoing work in the World Bank Data Group, we need to idenfity a dataset of global admin 2 boundaries that jibe with the World Bank's requirements for international boundaries.

Currently, the World Bank has an official-use only dataset of admin2 boundaries. This data started as a dataset from FAO in 2015/2016, that was snapped to medium-resolution (1:200,000) international boundaries acquired from [International Mapping Associates](https://internationalmapping.com/). The data has been manually edited and updated by the World Bank cartography department, with IMA maintaining the international boundaries.

This repo is looking at those medium-resolution boundaries to determine if they are appropriate for DECAT to use as a base for our database of sub-national statistics. To do that, We are going to compare four datasets:

1. Existing medium-resolution boundaries
2. High-resolution boundaries from IMA
3. Geoboundaries snapped to medium resolution international boundaries
4. Geoboundaries snapped to high-resolution international boundaries

For now, #3 and #4 are on hold.
